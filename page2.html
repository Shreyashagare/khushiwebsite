                  Unveil the essence of Europe through my 110-page photo magazine, a labor of love capturing the spirit
                  of Prague, the elegance of Budapest, and the coastal allure of Croatia. Melding artistic visuals with
                  brief, insightful articles, each page tells a story of my immersive journey, meticulously edited to
                  encapsulate the magic of these remarkable destinations.

                  I meticulously crafted a dynamic travel website for Millennial Travels, seamlessly blending

                  designing an engaging interface, every detail reflects the essence of modern travel. The website is a
                  digital gateway, inviting exploration into exciting destinations for the millennial adventurer.

                I artistically crafted posters for TYPODAY 2023, skillfully blending the theme: The
                Sacred&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp; Typography. These posters showcase a fusion of creativity and reverence.
                Additionally, I routinely design&nbsp;&nbsp;event posters for various events hosted at clubs, infusing
                each with a unique visual language that reflects the essence of the occasion.

                  Immersing myself in the iconic world of Barbie, I delved into extensive research on her diverse

                  I manually gathered data from Forbes India&#39;s 30 Under 30 list covering seven years. Compiling
                  details about winners&#39; professions, sex, and the states where their businesses originated, I
                  created sophisticated visualizations. These graphics unveil intricate patterns and insights, offering
